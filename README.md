# Inception V1 Model for Flowers Dataset

## Overview

This repository presents an in-depth exploration of the Inception V1 model's performance on the Flowers dataset. The project involves the manual implementation of the Inception V1 architecture and a comparative analysis against the results obtained from the built-in Inception V1 model.

## Dataset

The primary focus of this project is the Flowers dataset, a diverse collection of images showcasing various types of flowers. Leveraging this dataset allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the Inception V1 model's capabilities.

## Implementation

### Inception V1 Model from Scratch

The core feature of this repository is the ground-up implementation of the Inception V1 model. Each component of the architecture, including inception blocks, pooling layers, and dense layers, is crafted from scratch. This approach offers an in-depth understanding of the model's internal workings.

### Built-in Inception Model

In addition to the custom implementation, the project utilizes a pre-existing implementation of the Inception V1 model. This enables a direct comparison between the manually implemented model and the performance of the built-in version.

## Comparison and Results

The crux of this project lies in comparing the results obtained from the custom Inception V1 model with those from the built-in model on the Flowers dataset. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, loss, and any other relevant measures. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of the manual implementation of the built-in model.
